# [Psychotherapy AI Companion with Reinforcement Learning Recommendations and Interpretable Policy Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09601) 

## Abstract

* A Reinforcement Learning Psychotherapy AI Companion that generates topic recommendations for therapists based on patient responses.
* 4 different psychiatric conditions: anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, suicidal cases.
* Accuracy measured in terms of task, bond and goal
* Results:
  * The system is able to capture the real data relatively well.
  * _Best performing models vary by disorder and rating scale_
* To gain interpretable insight into the leearned policies, we visualize policy trajectories in a 2D principal Component analysis space and transition matrices
