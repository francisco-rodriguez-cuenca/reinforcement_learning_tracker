# [The self-organization of selfishness: Reinforcement Learning shows how selfish behavior can emerge from agent-environment interaction dynamics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14778)

## Abstract

* It is known that in biological communities, "free-riders" emerge.
* Free riders are agents that do not contribute to community resources, but do exploit them.
* Most models consider "free-riding" astable trait that evolves through mutation and selection.
* They present a reinforcement learning model that shows that free-riding behaviour and signaling-based coordination can emerge __within a generation__, and it is not a stable trait but dynamic "coagulation" of agent-environment interactions.
* How selfish behaviour can emerge through self-organization, and that the idea of selfishness as a stable trait presumes a model based on mutations.
