# [Reinforcement Learning with Knowledge Representation and Reasoning: A Brief Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.12090) INT INT

## Abstract

* Obstacles in RL:
  * Poor system generalization
  * low sample efficiency
  * safety and interpretability concerns
* Most of the work has focused on the computational aspect
  * value functions/policies
  * atomic components of rewards, states and actions
* Neglecting the rich high-level declarative domain knowledge of facts, relations and rules obtained a priori o through reasoning
* __Knowledge Representation and Reasoning__ methods
  * usually using logical languages
  * enable more abstract representation and efficient learning in RL
