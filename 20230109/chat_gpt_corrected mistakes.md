1. Introduction

    The challenge of value alignment centres upon the question of how to ensure that AI systems are properly aligned with human values and amenable to human control.

    Is something special about AI that makes questions about value more complicated or acute?
        Normative perspective: We are able to encode a richer set of values in AI systems than in simpler artifacts
        Technological perspective: Greater scope of action and intelligence create new challenges from the perspectives of alignment and control.

2. Technology and values

    Definition of value by Friedman and Henry from a technological perspective (2019):
        what is important to people in their lives, with a focus on ethics and morality
    Do Artifacts have politics? (Landgdon Winner, 1980)
        Examples
            Robert Moses: designed bridges in New York City to limit transport flows from poor to nice neighbourhoods
            Baron Haussman: redesigned the streets of Paris after the French revolution, so that it contained open boulevards that facilitated troop movement and suppressed the possibility of protest (Scott, 2020)
        technologies draw forth certain modes of social organization
        The need for large datasets and computer power favors centralized forms of political authority and governance (2018).
    There is no value neutral technology:
        New technologies make some outcomes more likely and some outcomes less likely to occur, they create new possibilities and sometimes exclude certain possibilities to be realized.
        Technologists are engaged in a world-making activity, there is a level of responsibility and the need for methods to ensure that technology aligns with human values (both personal and social)
        Key methods for value alignment: Stakeholder analysis and citizen consultation
    Technologists need to think about these issues early on, including whether to develop new technologies at all.

3. Is AI Special?
What is AI?

    Machines are intelligent to the extent that their actions can be expected to match their objectives (Stuart Russell, 2009)
    Machine Learning: family of statistical and algorithmic approaches:
        Supervised Learning: training a model to identify and respond to patterns in labelled datasets
        Unsupervised Learning: Aims to uncover patterns in un-labelled data and to perform tasks on that basis
        Reinforcement Learning: advanced and promising field of AI on which agents learn to maximize a numerical reward signal by interacting with their environment.

The potential uniqueness of AI Systems

    ML algorithms have the same concerns about injustice, safety, and unintended consequences that are present with other technologies
    Algorithmic bias: the potential to manifest a particular set of values:
    Social value misalignment: Algorithms in the criminal justice system, healthcare and facial analysis have been found to discriminate against women and non-white folks
    Challenges:
        Once the model has been trained it is hard to know why it decides one thing or another
        AI systems can make decisions or choices that are more meaningful that those encountered by technologies in the past
    Daniel Dennet degrees of freedom:
        A simple switch that can be turned
