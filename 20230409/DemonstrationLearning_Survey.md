## Abstract

* Demostration Learning is a paradigm in which an agent learns to perform a task by imitating the behaviour of an expert shown in demonstrations.
* Learning from demonstrations accelerates the learning process by improving sample efficiency, and reduces the programmer's effort.
* Survey of demonstration learning:
  * Formal introduction of the demonstration problem and challenges
  * Overview of the Demonstration Learning Process:
    * Creation of the dataset
    * Learning methods from demonstrations
    * Optimization by combination with other ML methods
  * Review benchmarks and their strengths and limitations
  * Advantages and disadvantages of Demonstration Learning, main applications
  * Open problems and research directions
