### [Context-aware Domain Adaptation for Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.07453)

* Due to label sparsity, training a deep anomaly detector often relies on unsupervised approaches. 
* We propose a framework that combines context sampling and anomaly detection into a joint learning procedure.
* We formulate context sampling into the Markov decision process and exploit deep reinforcement learning to optimize the time series domain adaptation process via context sampling and design a tailored reward function to generate domain-invariant features that better align two domains for anomaly detection.
