Reinforcement Learning

    multi-player co-operative games

    Although traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) techniques tend to work well when RL agents work with each other, they fail to work well when co-operating with humans (Siu et al., 2021; Bakhtin et al., 2021)

    text-based games

    problems: 

    main challenges with text-based games is the large action space available to agents

    common sense about how the world works

    Codenames is a good benchmark for both human-AI co-operation and text-based reinforcement learning,

Independent and Decentralized Learning in Markov Potential Games

    Uses MARL

    Focus on the independent and decentralized setting, where players can only observe the realized state and their own reward in every stage

    We prove that the policies induced by our learning dynamics converge to a stationary Nash equilibrium in Markov potential games with probability 1.

    Novel meta-learner-based framework from representation learning regarding behavioural similarities for reinforcement learning

Improving generalization in reinforcement learning through forked agents    

    An eco-system of agents each having their own policy with some, but limited, generalizability has proven a reliable approach to increase generalization across procedurally generated environments

    new agents are regularly added to the eco-system when encountering a new environment that is outside of the scope of the ecosystem

    the speed is highly dependent on the initialization of the new agents.

    In this paper we propose different initialization techniques, inspired from Deep Neural network initialization and transfer learning, and study their impact

Risk-Sensitive Policy with Distributional Reinforcement Learning

    Practical and accessible solution for learning risk-sensitive policies with minimal modification to the distributional RL Algorithm, and with an emphasis on the interpretability of the resulting decision-making process

    The core idea is to replace the Q function by another function taking into account both the expected return and the risk

Backward Curriculum Reinforcement Learning

    Reverse curriculum learning starts training the agent using the backward trajectory of the episode rather than the original forward trajectory.

    This gives the agent a strong reward signal, so the agent can learn in a more sample-efficient manner.

    our method only requires a minor change in algorithm, which is reversing the order of trajectory before training the agent. Therefore, it can be simply applied to any state-of-art algorithms.

POMRL: No-Regret Learning-to-Plan with Increasing Horizons

    We propose an algorithm to meta-learn the underlying structure across tasks, utilize it to plan in each task, and upper-bound the regret of the planning loss.

Outcome-Driven Reinforcement Learning via Variational Inference

    we view reinforcement learning as inferring policies that achieve desired outcomes, rather than as a problem of maximizing rewards
